# Arduino Project "LightKeyboard"

This small project was created in 2012 in the course "Arduino Goes Information Science" in the degree program "Information Science" at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt.
It was my first and only attempt so far with the cool little Arduino micro controller (Arduino Duemilanove with ATmega 328).

Anyway, I typed the code from my laboratory protocol and, due to the lack of an Arduino set, I didn't try it to see whether it still runs error-free.

There is a video on my "YT channel" if you're interested: <https://youtu.be/4Lu-LMIrBj8> ;)
